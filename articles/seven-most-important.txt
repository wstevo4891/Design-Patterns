=======================================
1. Singleton
=======================================
The singleton pattern is used to limit creation of a class to only one object.
This is beneficial when one (and only one) object is needed to coordinate
actions across the system.

Examples:
 - caches
 - thread pools
 - registries

It’s trivial to initiate an object of a class — but how do we ensure that only one object ever gets created? The answer is to make the constructor ‘private’ to the class we intend to define as a singleton. That way, only the members of the class can access the private constructor and no one else.

Important consideration: It’s possible to subclass a singleton by making the constructor protected instead of private. This might be suitable under some circumstances. One approach taken in these scenarios is to create a register of singletons of the subclasses and the getInstance method can take in a parameter or use an environment variable to return the desired singleton. The registry then maintains a mapping of string names to singleton objects, which can be accessed as needed.


=======================================
2. Factory Method
=======================================
A method that produces objects without specifying the exact class of the object
being created. To accomplish this, objects are created by calling a factory
method instead of calling a constructor.

Usual object creation in Java:
SomeClass someClassObject = new SomeClass()

The problem with this approach is that the code using SomeClass's
object now becomes dependent on the concrete implementation of SomeClass.

Using 'new' to create objects is fine, but it comes with the baggage
of tightly coupling code to the concrete implementation class.


=======================================
3. Strategy
=======================================
The strategy pattern allows grouping related algorithms under an abstraction,
which allows switching out one algorithm or policy for another without
modifying the client. Instead of directly implementing a single algorithm,
the code receives runtime instructions specifying which of the group of
algorithms to run.


=======================================
4. Observer
=======================================
This pattern is a one-to-many dependency between objects so
that when one object changes state, all its dependents are
notified. This is typically done by calling one of their methods.

For the sake of simplicity, think about what happens when you
follow someone on Twitter. You are essentially asking Twitter
to send you (the observer) tweet updates of the person
(the subject) you followed. The pattern consists of two
actors, the observer who is interested in the updates and
the subject who generates the updates.

A subject can have many observers and is a one to many relationship. However, an observer is free to subscribe to updates from other subjects too. You can subscribe to news feed from a Facebook page, which would be the subject and whenever the page has a new post, the subscriber would see the new post.

Key consideration:
In case of many subjects and few observers, if each subject stores its observers separately, it’ll increase the storage costs as some subjects will be storing the same observer multiple times.


=======================================
5. Builder
=======================================
As the name implies, a builder pattern is used to build objects. Sometimes, the objects we create can be complex, made up of several sub-objects or require an elaborate construction process. The exercise of creating complex types can be simplified by using the builder pattern. A composite or an aggregate object is what a builder generally builds.

Key consideration: The builder pattern might seem similar to the ‘abstract factory’ pattern but one difference is that the builder pattern creates an object step by step whereas the abstract factory pattern returns the object in one go.


=======================================
6. Adapter
=======================================
This allows incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into another. Think of it as a sort of translator: when two heads of states who don’t speak a common language meet, usually an interpreter sits between the two and translates the conversation, thus enabling communication.


If you have two applications, with one spitting out  XML and the other requiring JSON input, then you’ll need an adapter between the two to make them work seamlessly.


=======================================
7. State
=======================================
The state pattern encapsulates the various states a machine can be in, and allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The machine or the context, as it is called in pattern-speak, can have actions taken on it that propel it into different states. Without the use of the pattern, the code becomes inflexible and littered with if-else conditionals.
