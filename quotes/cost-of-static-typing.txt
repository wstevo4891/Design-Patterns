***Cost of Static Typing***

Statically typed languages are so pervasive these days that a key question is rarely asked: What is the cost of static typing? My answer is that static typing costs a lot. In fact, in the currency of programming effort and code clutter, static typing costs a fortune. Look at a Java or C# program and count the number of tokens devoted to parameter and variable declarations. Add in most of the interfaces. Donâ€™t forget those pesky class casts, where you convince the typing system that, yes, that really is a String over there. Add a bonus for each complex generic declaration. All of this code clutter is not free.[2]
